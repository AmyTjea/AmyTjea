## Welcome, welcome stranger ðŸ‘‹
I'm Amy, lovely to have you here!

### About me âœ¨

I'm currently completing my penultimate year at Monash University, and am on the verge of completing my Bachelor's of Computer Science and Engineering (Software). I've done a lot of coding in the React space, being the lead of the team who developed [the Monash Human Power Website](https://monashhumanpower.org/), and also have done a fair amount of toying with some silly projects.

Aside from code, I absolutely love games, and unfortunately have sunk too many hour playing shooters and rogue-likes, though I'd like to argue it just shows that I love a good challenge! Even if it means hitting my head on the same wall ðŸ’ªðŸ˜¤

 ### My Current WorkðŸŒ±
 Unfortunately I've found myself in three group projects for one uni semester... so you'll get to check that out later!
