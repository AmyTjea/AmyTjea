## Welcome, welcome stranger ðŸ‘‹
I'm Amy!

I'm currently completing my penultimate year at Monash University, and am on the verge of completing my Bachelor's of Computer Science and Engineering (Software).
I absolutely love games, and unfortunately have sunk too many hour playing shooters and rogue-likes, although I'd like to argue it just shows that I love a good challenge, even if it means hitting my head on the same wall ðŸ’ªðŸ˜¤
